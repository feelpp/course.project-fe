== A joint project between C++ for Scientific Computing and Project Development and Management

This project is part of a collaborative effort between two courses: C++
for Scientific Computing and Project Development and Management. The
goal is to provide students with a comprehensive learning experience
that combines advanced C++ programming techniques with essential
software engineering and project management practices.

In the C++ for Scientific Computing component, students will focus on
implementing a finite element method (FEM) to solve a Poisson-type
partial differential equation (PDE) in a 2D domain. This involves
understanding the mathematical formulation of the problem, translating
it into efficient C++ code, and using tools such as Eigen and Gmsh for
linear algebra and mesh generation. The project emphasizes the
development of high-performance, well-structured, and reusable code for
scientific applications.

In the Project Development and Management course, students are
introduced to modern development workflows and tools that are critical
for software projects. This includes version control with GitHub,
continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub
Actions, unit testing, and Docker for containerization. These practices
ensure that the code developed is not only functionally correct but also
maintainable, testable, and easily deployable.

By combining these two courses, students are expected to gain both
technical skills in scientific computing and proficiency in
collaborative software development techniques. This joint project
simulates real-world scenarios where complex technical tasks must be
managed in parallel with software engineering practices, preparing
students for careers in both academia and industry.

This introduction emphasizes how the project benefits from the
collaboration between the two courses and highlights the skills students
will gain from both the technical and project management perspectives.
