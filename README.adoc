= {cpp} Finite Element Method Project
:cpp: C++

This repository contains the code, LaTeX files, and other resources for the {cpp} Finite Element Method (FEM) project. The project involves solving a Poisson-type partial differential equation (PDE) in a 2D domain using FEM and includes documentation and source code to guide students through the implementation, testing, and reporting process.

== Repository Structure

- `project.tex`: The main LaTeX file for the project, describing the objectives, methods, and overall instructions for solving the FEM problem.
- `report.tex`: A template for the students to use when writing their project report.
- `meshes/`: Contains various mesh files (.msh) that students will use for their FEM simulations.
- `src/`: Contains sample {cpp} code to help students get started with FEM implementation.
- `tex/`: Includes LaTeX macros used by `project.tex` and `report.tex`.
- `.vscode/`: VSCode configuration for LaTeX settings, ensuring consistent formatting and build processes for LaTeX documents.

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

To work on this project, youâ€™ll need the following tools installed:

{cpp} Compiler:: Ensure you have a {cpp} compiler like `g++` or `clang++`.
Eigen Library:: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/[Eigen] is used for linear algebra in this project.
Gmsh:: https://gmsh.info/[Gmsh] is used for generating mesh files.
LaTeX:: For generating project reports and reading project documentation.
Git:: Version control for tracking your progress and submitting your project.
VSCode with LaTeX Workshop:: Recommended editor for LaTeX. The `.vscode/` directory contains settings for this.

=== Using the LaTeX Files

project.tex:: This file contains detailed project instructions. Compile it with:
[source,bash]
----
pdflatex project.tex
----

report.tex:: Use this template to create your project report. Customize it with your own content, results, and analysis. Compile it similarly:
[source,bash]
----
pdflatex report.tex
----

NOTE: vscode has been configure to have the LaTeX workshop extension and uses latexmk to compile from the interface


== Project Workflow

=== Version Control with GitHub

Repository Setup:: Clone this repository to your local machine:
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/master-csmi/your_project.git
----

Branching:: Create a new branch specific branches for the issues/features/bugs
[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b <the branch>
----
Commits:: Make commits regularly with meaningful messages:
[source,bash]
----
git commit -m "Implemented FEM solver"
----
Pull Requests:: When ready, push your branch and open a pull request (PR) to merge changes into the `main` branch. The PR will make checks that the code compiles, executes and the tests are giving the proper results.

=== Continuous Integration (CI)
This project is set up with **GitHub Actions** to automatically compile and test your code with every push. The CI configuration file is located in `.github/workflows/`. To set up CI:
1. Write unit tests for your FEM code.
2. Ensure tests are automatically run with each PR by configuring GitHub Actions.

=== Containerization with Docker
To make your project easily reproducible, you have to containerize it using **Docker**. The repository can include a `Dockerfile` that compiles and runs the {cpp} code inside a Docker container:
[source,bash]
----
docker build -t <> .
docker run fem_project
----
NOTE: the docker image must be generated from the GitHub Action.

== Documentation

=== Project Overview
The project covers the following key topics:
- Solving Poisson-type PDEs using FEM.
- Meshing using `Gmsh` and processing meshes in {cpp}.
- Post-processing of results using **ParaView**.

=== Report Guidelines
Use `report.tex` to structure your project report, including:
- A brief description of the project.
- Explanation of the algorithms and code structures.
- Results obtained from running your FEM solver.
- Analysis of the results (e.g., convergence behavior, accuracy, performance).
